Brief
During the course of this project, we created an interactive experience in which a robot arm picks up a ball, rotates it, and then allows it to fall down a ramp. The ball travels along the routes until it reaches the base of the robot arm. Using fundamental 3D models, animations, and collision interactions in Godot, the project's primary objective is to develop a system that is not only straightforward but also fully functional. Having the opportunity to gain practical experience in animation, physics simulation, and game design was a significant benefit of this work.

Key Concepts
Physics Simulation: Simulating the ballâ€™s movement with gravity as it rolls down the ramp.
Animation: Animating the robot arm's movement using Path3D.
Camera Setup: Creating a player-controlled camera to view the scene.
Greyboxing: Planning the layout using placeholders for efficient design.

Features
Interactive Animation: The robot arm moves along a defined Path3D to pick up and drop the ball.
Realistic Physics: Simulated ball movement using gravity, ramps, and pathways.
User-Friendly Camera: A dynamic camera system that allows smooth tracking of the gameplay.
